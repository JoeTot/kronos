/*
Package checksumfile can be used to persist data to a file so that it is never
corrupted. It only works on unix* systems as it writes data to a temp file and
uses rename syscall to move the file atomically.
An example is:

	func main() {
		data := []byte{"Hello World!"}
		filename := "var/lib/kronos/nodeInfo" // directory in which file is
		// stored should exist beforehand and have w and x permissions for user,
	 	// otherwise write will fail.
		if err :=  checksumfile.Write(filename, data) {
			panic(err)
		}
		read, err := checksumfile.Read(filename)
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}
	  fmt.Println(read)
	}
